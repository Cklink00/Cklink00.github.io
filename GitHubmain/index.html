        <P id="two">Let me take you on a mental journey of discovery. Where we discover together how to overcome the fact that I am better than you. There's many reasons why one would want to be me, but let's start with a few key points:</P>
          <ul>
              <li>I'm more Racist</li>
              <li>I'm more Talented</li>
              <li>I'm more Sexist</li>
              <li>I am better looking than you</li>
              <li>I'm more Intelligent</li>
              <li>I slam beers like its my wife after a long day of work and theres no food on the table</li>
